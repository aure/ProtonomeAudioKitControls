# ProtonomeAudioKitControls

ProtonomeAudioKitControls is a collection of IBDesignable-compatible controls for use with AudioKit 2.

This is mostly a set of opinionated classes I wanted to share between my own apps, but I think there might be something of use here for other AudioKit users, too.

## Installation:

```ruby
pod 'ProtonomeAudioKitControls', '~> 0.2'
```

## Classes:

- DialControl
- PickerControl
- SliderControl
- AudioPlot

## Todo:

- Better name
- Examples
